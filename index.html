          <strong>Sir Isaac Newton</strong> PRS (25 December 1642 – 20 March 1726/27[a]) was an
          English mathematician, physicist, astronomer, theologian, and author
          (described in his own day as a "natural philosopher") who is widely
          recognised as one of the most influential scientists of all time and
          as a key figure in the scientific revolution. His book Philosophiæ
          Naturalis Principia Mathematica (Mathematical Principles of Natural
          Philosophy), first published in 1687, established classical mechanics.
          Newton also made seminal contributions to optics, and shares credit
          with Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz for developing the infinitesimal
          calculus. In Principia, Newton formulated the laws of motion and
          universal gravitation that formed the dominant scientific viewpoint
          until it was superseded by the theory of relativity. Newton used his
          mathematical description of gravity to derive Kepler's laws of
          planetary motion, account for tides, the trajectories of comets, the
          precession of the equinoxes and other phenomena, eradicating doubt
          about the Solar System's heliocentricity. He demonstrated that the
          motion of objects on Earth and celestial bodies could be accounted for
          by the same principles. Newton's inference that the Earth is an oblate
          spheroid was later confirmed by the geodetic measurements of
          Maupertuis, La Condamine, and others, convincing most European
          scientists of the superiority of Newtonian mechanics over earlier
          systems. Newton built the first practical reflecting telescope and
          developed a sophisticated theory of colour based on the observation
          that a prism separates white light into the colours of the visible
          spectrum. His work on light was collected in his highly influential
          book Opticks, published in 1704. He also formulated an empirical law
          of cooling, made the first theoretical calculation of the speed of
          sound, and introduced the notion of a Newtonian fluid. In addition to
          his work on calculus, as a mathematician Newton contributed to the
          study of power series, generalised the binomial theorem to non-integer
          exponents, developed a method for approximating the roots of a
          function, and classified most of the cubic plane curves. Newton was a
          fellow of Trinity College and the second Lucasian Professor of
          Mathematics at the University of Cambridge. He was a devout but
          unorthodox Christian who privately rejected the doctrine of the
          Trinity. Unusually for a member of the Cambridge faculty of the day,
          he refused to take holy orders in the Church of England. Beyond his
          work on the mathematical sciences, Newton dedicated much of his time
          to the study of alchemy and biblical chronology, but most of his work
          in those areas remained unpublished until long after his death.
          Politically and personally tied to the Whig party, Newton served two
          brief terms as Member of Parliament for the University of Cambridge,
          in 1689–90 and 1701–02. He was knighted by Queen Anne in 1705 and
          spent the last three decades of his life in London, serving as Warden
          (1696–1699) and Master (1699–1727) of the Royal Mint, as well as
          president of the Royal Society (1703–1727).
